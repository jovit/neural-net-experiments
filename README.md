# neural-net-experiments

This repo contains two implementations of a neural network for solving the MNIST dataset. The first one implemented in javascript (which failed miserably due to horrible memory leaks, still have allocation errors ptsd), and another one made in python which is still painfully slow but works reasonably.

The implementation isn't by any means good, it was done just for fun.
